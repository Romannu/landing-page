## This is the Landing Page project from The Odin Project

I will be creating a webpage from a design offered by The Odin Project. The design to be used can be found in the two images inside the directory /source-img.

This page will showcase many of the teachings from the past CSS learning sections, and more to be searched by me if needed.

I hope I can do this page easily, and learn more CSS features as I build it.
